This monorepo was created with `pnpm` for space efficiency and more convienence
in monorepos than `npm`.

## Local development

**All the following commands are run from the root of the monorepo.**

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

Given the name of our app in `package.json` is `@epic-stack-monorepo/epic-app`:

Turborepo is used here to have pipeline between packages. The setup here is
basic, and you can see turbo as just a way to run the same `pnpm` command in all
packages, for example:

### Build all packages

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Dev all packages

```bash
pnpm dev
```

All turborepo // pnpm commands can be filtered to a specific package with the
`--filter` flag. For example:

### To Work on the Remix Epic Stack app

```bash
pnpm dev --filter=@epic-stack-monorepo/epic-app
```

You could also use `...` to run dev also on all the workspace packages deps:

```bash
pnpm dev --filter=@epic-stack-monorepo/epic-app...
```

(This will also run the dev command on `@epic-stack-monorepo/client-hints` and
`@epic-stack-monorepo/ui`).

## Install package in a specific package

```bash
pnpm add -D chokidar --filter=@epic-stack-monorepo/ui
```

This will install `chokidar` in the `@epic-stack-monorepo/ui` package.
